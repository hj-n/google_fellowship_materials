			These materials are used for my Google Ph.D. Fellowship application in 2024. Having been selected as a recipient, I have received several requests to share my application materials. As I benefited from publicly shared resources during my application process, I am making my materials available here. Note that I have also included links to publicly accessible materials that informed my application. I hope these resources assist you in your own application.

			<h2>Research Statement</h2>
			<p>
				I attached the PDF of my research statement and the LaTeX source code. The design of the research statement is based on the ones provided by Dr. Fumeng Yang (<a href="https://www.fmyang.com/files/statements/Fumeng_Yang-RS_2023.pdf" target="_blank">Link</a>) and Dr. Zhu-Tian Chen (<a href="https://chenzhutian.org/docs/RS.pdf" target="_blank">Link</a>). All the LaTeX source code is written by me and is fine-tuned to fit my contents, thus needs some hand-tuning to align with your contents. I recently found that Dr. Yang has publicized her template, which seems to be more polished than mine. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/Fumeng-Yang/template-research-statement-2024" target="_blank">here</a>.

			</ul>
			<h2>Essay Responses</h2>
			<p>
				While writing the essay responses, I focused on maintaining a consistency with the research statement. Such efforts are not limited to the content but also for design (e.g., font that I used).

			<h2>CV</h2>
			<p>
				As the CV that I submitted to Google contains some information that have some risks of being publicly shared (e.g., papers and grants under review), I am not able to share the exact version that I submitted. I instead share my CV and source code at the time of establishing this website (May 2025). It is worth noting that the design of my CV is based on the one provided by Dr. Fumeng Yang (<a href="https://www.fmyang.com/files/statements/Fumeng_Yang-CV_2024Feb.pdf" target="_blank">Link</a>), but the LaTeX source code is written by me.
